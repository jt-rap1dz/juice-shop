OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## Setup

3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you change the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost>
